Welcome to Druppets v1.0
source: www.timonweb.com/druppets

Druppets is a set of commonly used snippets of Drupal 6 Code. This set should help with some common and repetitive coding tasks.
The first version of druppets is available for Aptana IDE only (www.aptana.com). It may work with Eclipse based IDEs also,
but I never tested this. Works ok with Aptana 1.5 on PC. Should be ok with Linux/Mac also.

-------------
1) Aptana IDE installed. Preferrably version 1.5+
